The simplest, free Windows program for trading (without cents). Designed for a specific store, but is universal
for small outlets. It is constantly being improved and includes only the most necessary functionality:

- Barcode generator and price tag printing.
- List of ending items.
- Sales statistics for the entire period of work.
- Product search by barcode or keyword.
- Record in the file of each fact of sale of goods.
- Customer base editor
- Printing individual discount cards
- Printing unregistered discount cards (registration at the time of sale).
- Tips to the seller during settlements with the client.
- The possibility of fully autonomous operation (without a scanner, printers, the Internet. Only a laptop.)
- Support for a barcode scanner, receipt printer and label printer.
- Ability to change the exchange rate (selling goods only in national currency).
- Multitasking: the ability to serve multiple customers at the same time.
- And yes! No ads!
The latest version adds:
- Acceptance of goods in several ways (just get all the goods out of the box and read the bar codes)
- Quick change of the seller. If several sellers work, you can identify with a
single keystroke (for example, F1, F2 or F3). Information will be reflected in the check and the log file.
